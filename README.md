# üí° AI-Powered Dynamic Pricing Engine

**Live Demo:** http://10.41.209.102:8501
## üéØ Problem Statement

In e-commerce and retail, setting the right price for a product is a critical challenge. A price too high deters customers, while a price too low reduces potential revenue. This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution that uses machine learning to recommend the optimal price for a product on a given day to maximize revenue.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Dynamic Price Recommendation:** Get an optimal price recommendation based on a selected date.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** An interactive Plotly chart shows the relationship between price and predicted revenue, explaining *why* the price is optimal.
*   **Full-Stack Implementation:** Covers the complete pipeline from data simulation and model training to a user-facing web app.
*   **Deployment-Ready:** The entire application is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and reproducibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Modeling:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
*   **Frontend:** Streamlit
*   **Data Visualization:** Plotly
*   **Containerization:** Docker
